# What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

# What is npm? How does it work?

npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows users to install, share, and manage dependencies for Node.js projects.

# What is an event loop in Node.js?

The event loop is a single-threaded loop that handles all asynchronous callbacks in Node.js, allowing it to perform non-blocking I/O operations.

# What is the role of the "require" method in Node.js?

The "require" method is used to include modules that exist in separate files and exposes their functionality to the current file.

# Explain the concept of streams in Node.js.

Streams in Node.js are objects that enable the efficient handling of data flow, allowing for the processing of large datasets without consuming a large amount of memory.

# What is callback hell and how can it be avoided?

Callback hell refers to the situation where multiple nested callbacks make the code hard to read and maintain. It can be avoided by using promises, async/await, or modularizing the code.

# What are the benefits of using Node.js?

Node.js provides several benefits, including high scalability, non-blocking I/O, a large ecosystem of open-source packages, and the ability to use JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development.

# What is the purpose of the "package.json" file?

The "package.json" file contains metadata about the Node.js project, including its dependencies, scripts, and other configurations.

# How does Node.js handle child threads?

Node.js does not directly create child threads but allows the creation of child processes to handle heavy computation tasks using the "child_process" module.

# Explain the difference between "process.nextTick" and "setImmediate" in Node.js.

"process.nextTick" queues a function to be executed at the beginning of the next event loop iteration, whereas "setImmediate" queues a function to be executed at the end of the current event loop iteration.

# What is the purpose of the "Buffer" class in Node.js?

The "Buffer" class in Node.js provides a way to handle binary data, allowing for the manipulation of streams and file system operations.

# How can you handle errors in Node.js?

Errors in Node.js can be handled using try-catch blocks, error-first callbacks, promises, or by using popular error-handling libraries like "express-async-errors" or "joi".
What is the role of the "module.exports" and "exports" in Node.js?

"module.exports" and "exports" are used to expose modules in Node.js. "module.exports" is used to export the entire module, while "exports" is a reference to "module.exports" and is used to export multiple properties or functions from a module.

# What is the difference between "require" and "import" in Node.js?

"require" is used in Node.js to import modules, while "import" is part of the ECMAScript standard and is typically used with a transpiler like Babel when using newer JavaScript features in Node.js.
How can you make your Node.js application production-ready?

To make a Node.js application production-ready, one should focus on error handling, logging, security, performance optimization, and utilizing tools like process managers, load balancers, and reverse proxies.


Explain the JavaScript event loop.

Is JavaScript single-threaded or multi-threaded?

Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions, and an example of when each one is a better choice.

Explain promises and callback functions.

How does async/await differ from promises?

Explain the difference between child_process.spawn() and child_process.fork()

Give examples of a function expression, a function definition, and an arrow function.

Explain the difference between CommonJS and ESModules.

What is an event emitter?

Is FS.readfile() a synchronous function or asynchronous?

Name one important feature added in ES6.
